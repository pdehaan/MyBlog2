  My wife and I are planning to move somewhere where you can walk to shops and restaurants. We were thinking about selling or renting our current suburbia home. So, as usual, I picked up a bunch of books from the local library. This is one of them. Amazon reviews are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/007142220X/qid=1091030040/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-6539857-7887162?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">here</a>.

  <b>My opinion on the book</b>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">
  The author did a good job of providing numeric evidence of the possibility of a real estate bubble. What I didn't like is that he didn't provide a logical framework to evaluate residential real estate. I was expecting some sort of DCF model that uses rent as the free cash flow. Instead he cites Median house/Median Income and some other contingent evidence to prove his point. It is like a book on stock evaluation that just uses historical P/E as a measure. He also fail to present similar situations that resulted&nbsp;in a crisis. Quite disappointing in that regard

  <b>How it relates to my choice of sell or rent</b>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">
  I created my own excel spreadsheet to look at the two different scenarios (if you are interested I can share). It looks like renting is the loosing one. We gain more by selling and investing the equity in a conservative way. The book made me take a hard look at our local real estate market: the ratio Median House/Median Income is about 4.3 (above 3 is bad). Rents are low and house prices have been growing like crazy. This makes me think to buy a small condo, or even to rent for a while. We haven't really decided yet.
