Interesting [read](http://www.strategy-business.com/press/enewsarticle/enews053107?pg=all) on what open source has been good for, on the difference between Linux and Wikipedia and on how to best harness the power of crowds.

Also a highly positively reviewed [new book](http://www.amazon.com/Difference-Diversity-Creates-Schools-Societies/dp/0691128383/ref=sr_1_1/104-4425703-5061533?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1183651116&sr=8-1) that formalizes in almost mathematical fashion what diversity is good for (I haven’t read it yet). The classical work on the matter is “[The Wisdom of crowds](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385721706/sr=8-1/qid=1183651116/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/104-4425703-5061533?ie=UTF8&qid=1183651116&sr=8-1)”.

One can test, debug and improve in bazaar style, but it would be very hard to _originate_ a project in bazaar mode.” In a recent e-mail to me, he was even blunter. “The individual wizard,” he wrote, “is where successful bazaar projects generally start.” “
