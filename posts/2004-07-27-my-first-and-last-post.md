  Hello folks,
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;">
  My crazy coworkers finally convinced me to get my own blog. They think I'll say something funny, but I won't  - so don't link to me  - it's probably not worth it. For the few perseverant ones, here is what I plan to talk about: object orientation, c#, sports, financial stuff and books (not in that order). See you later.

  BTW: strange how this blog thing reduces the complexity of one's personality to a bunch of categories on the left of the screen
