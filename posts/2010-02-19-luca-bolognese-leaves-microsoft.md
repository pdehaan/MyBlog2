<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>FYI I imported all the posts from the old MSDN blog to this one. Hence this post doesn't make sense anymore. I left it here for memory sake. BTW: I am also back in msft now (30/11/2018).</strong></span>
  
This is my last post on this blog. My new blog is here: [http://www.lucabol.com ](http://www.lucabol.com  "http://www.lucabol.com ")
  
I accepted a role as Director for Credit Suisse in London. I’m excited by the opportunity to work in the financial industry, a long-standing desire of mine. I’m also excited to write more F# code and to be closer to Italy, where my extended family is.
  
The past ten years in Microsoft have been a wild ride. I’m proud to have been part of ObjectSpaces, Generics, LINQ and F# (and much more …). I’ve been lucky to be able to post on this blog and present at conferences about such innovative technologies. It has all been a lot of fun. I’m sure the next ten years will be as good.
  
I’ll see you guys on my new blog.
